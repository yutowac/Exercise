These tutorials are meant for everyone (from novice to advanced). We will start from the very basics. No rush!\nThese tutorials are meant to improve your understanding of the two frameworks TensorFlow and JAX. We will start with TensorFlow and will cover JAX side-by-side. This isn't typically a documentation-type tutorial, and these aren't meant to be the replacement. These are meant to give you insights with minimal effort. Sit tight and let's start!\n\n**Note** The tutorials will be following this format:\n1. TF Fundamentals (2-3 notebooks)\n2. JAX Fundamentals (2-3 notebooks)\n3. Advanced TF (2-3 notebooks)\n4.
