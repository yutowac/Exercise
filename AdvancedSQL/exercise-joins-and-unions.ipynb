Armed with this knowledge, you plan to use this information to better design the order in which questions are presented to Stack Overflow users.\n\nWith this goal in mind, you write the query below, which focuses on questions asked in January 2018.

Is it more common for users to first ask questions or provide answers?  After signing up, how long does it take for users to first interact with the website?  To explore this further, you draft the (partial) query in the code cell below.\n\nThe query returns a table with three columns:\n- `owner_user_id` - the user ID\n- `q_creation_date` - the first time the user asked a question \n- `a_creation_date` - the first time the user contributed an answer \n\nYou want to keep track of users who have asked questions, but have yet to provide answers.  And, your table should also include users who have answered questions, but have yet to pose their own questions.  \n\nWith this in mind, please fill in the appropriate **JOIN** (i.e., **INNER**, **LEFT**, **RIGHT**, or **FULL**) to return the correct information.  \n\n**Note**: You need only fill in the appropriate **JOIN**.  All other parts of the query should be left as-is.  (You also don't need to write any additional code to run the query, since the `check()` method will take care of this for you.)\n\nTo avoid returning too much data, we'll restrict our attention to questions and answers posed in January 2019.

To answer this question, you'll need to pull information from *three* different tables!  This syntax very similar to the case when we have to join only two tables.  For instance, consider the three tables below.\n\n![three tables](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/learn/images/OyhYtD1.png)\n\nWe can use two different **JOINs** to link together information from all three tables, in a single query.\n\n![double join](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/learn/images/G6buS7P.png)\n\nWith this in mind, say you're interested in understanding users who joined the site in January 2019.  You want to track their activity on the site: when did they post their first questions and answers, if ever?\n\nWrite a query that returns the following columns:\n- `id` - the IDs of all users who created Stack Overflow accounts in January 2019 (January 1, 2019, to January 31, 2019, inclusive)\n- `q_creation_date` - the first time the user posted a question on the site; if the user has never posted a question, the value should be null\n- `a_creation_date` - the first time the user posted a question on the site; if the user has never posted a question, the value should be null\n\nNote that questions and answers posted after January 31, 2019, should still be included in the results.  And, all users who joined the site in January 2019 should be included (even if they have never posted a question or provided an answer).\n\nThe query from the previous question should be a nice starting point to answering this question!  You'll need to use the `posts_answers` and `posts_questions` tables.  You'll also need to use the `users` table from the Stack Overflow dataset.
